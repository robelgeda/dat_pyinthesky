# James Webb Space Telescope Data Analysis Tool Notebooks (pyinthesky)

``jdat_notebooks`` are one component of STScI's larger [Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis).

``dat_pyinthesky`` is intended for the developer community wishing to contribute notebooks or technical expertise.  If you are part of the broader community wishing to use the finalized notebooks, we refer you to [jdat_notebooks](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks).  If you wish to contribute notebooks, please follow [contributing instructions](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/blob/master/contributing.md).

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks intended for the developer community wishing to contribute notebooks or technical expertise.  The notebooks illustrate workflows for post-pipeline analysis of JWST data. The notebooks are likely to be useful for analyzing data from other observatories as well.

The notebooks attempt to utilize a number of software packages supported by STScI, including [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org), [glue](http://docs.glueviz.org/en/stable/index.html), [ginga](https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [photutils](https://photutils.readthedocs.io), [specutils](https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [astroimtools](http://astroimtools.readthedocs.io), [imexam](http://imexam.readthedocs.io), [jdaviz](https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [asdf](http://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [gwcs](https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [synphot](http://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).  Note jdaviz is STScI's JWST Data Analysis Visualization Tool, designed to be used with spectra, IFU cubes, and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS).
