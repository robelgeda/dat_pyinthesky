    "This notebook is part of a series of notebooks that are being prepared by STScI in order to showcase how to simulate, process and analyze JWST observations for a wide range of science cases. Here, we touch on the transiting exoplanet observations science case and, in particular, on spectrophotometric observations of the *primary transit of an exoplanet*. During primary transit, the observed flux decrease due to the planet blocking light from the stellar host is proportional to $\\delta = (R_p/R_*)^2$ --- a quantity known as the *transit depth*, where $R_p$ is the planetary radius and $R_*$ is the stellar radius. Interestingly, the transit depth is wavelength dependent; i.e., $\\delta \\equiv \\delta (\\lambda)$. This is because opacity sources on the planetary atmosphere absorb different amounts of light at different wavelengths and, therefore, the observed planetary radius $R_p$ --- and thus occulted area during transit, $\\delta$ --- is wavelength-dependent (see, e.g., [Kreidberg 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018haex.bookE.100K/abstract) for a review). This technique, referred to as *transmission spectroscopy* in what follows, aims at obtaining those transit depths as a function of wavelength in JWST observations through the study of ultra-precise transit lightcurves at different wavelengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated data for NIRISS/SOSS observations targeting a transit of HAT-P-1b have been generated with the help of the [`awesimsoss` simulator](https://github.com/spacetelescope/awesimsoss/) by the NIRISS team. These simulations, in turn, have been calibrated using the [JWST pipeline](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/). HAT-P-1b is a Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) target of the [NIRISS Exploration of the Atmospheric diversity of Transiting exoplanets (NEAT) program](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/jwst-cycle-1-guaranteed-time-observations-call-for-proposals/jwst-gto-observation-specifications/jwst-gto-niriss-observations-table), which will be observed using the [NIRISS/SOSS](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-observing-modes/niriss-single-object-slitless-spectroscopy) instrument onboard JWST. This target is also used as an [example science program used in the JWST documentation](https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/near-infrared-imager-and-slitless-spectrograph/niriss-example-science-programs/niriss-soss-time-series-observations-of-hat-p-1). If you are not familiar with transiting exoplanet observations and/or with how JWST will observe planetary transits, we encourage you to read through that example science program in order to familiarize yourself with the terminology.\n",

    "In this notebook, we analyze the 2D spectral products of the JWST pipeline in order to analyze the transmission spectrum of this exoplanet. In particular, the data we take a look at here has been processed by the JWST pipeline up to the `assign_wcs` step of the pipeline's [Stage 2 processing](https://jwst-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jwst/pipeline/calwebb_spec2.html#calwebb-spec2). The simulations didn't include flat-fielding, so we don't apply the flat-field step of the pipeline to them. Although the JWST Pipeline will eventually be able to produce white-light lightcurves, as well as extracted 1D spectra, as of the day of writing of this notebook, the JWST calibration pipeline does not have a spectral extraction algorithm that can deal with the complicated structure of NIRISS/SOSS data. In particular, the `SUBSTRIP256` subarray has data from at least two NIRISS/SOSS orders, which overlap at the reddest wavelengths. An algorithm to properly extract this data is in-the-making, but in this notebook we will be performing our own tracing and extraction of the spectra in order to showcase how to analyze the JWST pipeline products. After extracting the spectrum, we will generate the white-light lightcurves of each order, fit them and compare the extracted parameters to the ones in the literature. Then, we will repeat the procedures for the wavelength-dependent lightcurves, with which we will get the transmission spectrum of the exoplanet. \n",

    "This plot tells us a lot about how to move forward with the data analysis in general of this dataset. For example, note that although the pipeline has done a good job at removing structure in the data, there is still some structure which appears as vertical strips. This is a well known pattern due to the readout of IR detectors which is typically referred to as \"1/f noise\". By eye it seems some simple column-by-column background substraction should take care of that. On top of this, this image tells us a little bit of the care we have to have with tracing. For example, spectra of order 1 and 2 start to overlap around pixel ~750. In addition, we can see how the right side of both traces are the ones that have the most signal, which decreases to the left-hand side (redder wavelengths) --- so if we do any kind of iterative tracing, we should perhaps start in those sides of the trace. With tracing we also have to be careful with the sides of the image: both sides have 4 reference pixels each (i.e, pixels 0 to 3 and 2044 to 2048) which are not sensitive to light, so we have to be careful to leave those out of our analyses. Finally, it is important to note that the order in the bottom of this image (order 2) ends rather abruptly at around column 1750; this is actually a problem of the simulations, and not a real feature of the NIRISS/SOSS traces. \n",

    "Let's use all of the above to our advantage to trace the spectra of each integration. First, let's write a small script to get the centroids of each column for each order on each integration.

We repeat this procedure in each of the columns of the image in order to obtain the centroids of the traces, and then we fit them with a polynomial:"

    "Woah, pretty good for such a simple approach! There are evidently some parts of the traces that go a bit off-board. In particular, the trace goes off at values below around 30. Let's fit a Chebyshev polynomial for each of them so we can smooth the shape a little bit, being careful not to use these pixels that throw the trace off in the fit. We could do some iterative fitting but, as we will see below, this is not terribly important. To select the best order for this polynomial, let's write a small function that does model selection using the [Bayesian Information Criterion](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344136) (BIC) for each trace, and then select the best order via \"majority vote\":"

On top of this, we fix some parameters in our fit as well: we don't fit for the eccentricity $e$ (`ecc_p1`) or argument of periastron passage $\\omega$ (`omega_p1`), as a single transit does not hold much information on these parameters. Similarly, we fix any possible dilution of the transit lightcurve by background sources (`mdilution_SOSS`) to 1, so we assume no dilution is in place.

    "Nice! As can be seen, this plot comes very handy. First of all, note how the transit is marked in the dark regions at all wavelengths where it is expected (i.e., where we saw them in the white-light lightcurves --- time of transit around 3.5 hours since start of observations). One can actually see how the lightcurves get noisier for longer wavelengths, which makes sense with the image plots (the traces fade to the left of all of our image/trace plots). On top of this, we can see that some lightcurves seem to be a bit noisier/corrupted than usual for Order 1 at the shorter wavelengths. We won't worry too much about those here, but this is a very important application of this kind of plots, which allow us to visually see outlier lightcurves in one simple image.\n",

The Order 1 transmission spectrum, on the other hand, shows a very clear detection of several water bands in the entire NIRISS/SOSS range.
