JWST Data Analysis Tool Notebooks (pyinthesky)
----------------------------------------------

`jdat_notebooks` are one component of STScI's larger
`Data Analysis Tools Ecosystem <https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-post-pipeline-data-analysis>`_.

`dat_pyinthesky` is intended for the developer community wishing to contribute notebooks or technical expertise.  If
you are part of the broader community wishing to use the finalized notebooks, we refer you to
`jdat_notebooks <(https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks>`_.
If you wish to contribute notebooks, please follow
`contributing instructions <https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdat_notebooks/blob/master/contributing.md>`_.

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks intended for the developer community wishing to contribute notebooks or
technical expertise.  The notebooks illustrate workflows for post-pipeline analysis of JWST data. The notebooks are
likely to be useful for analyzing data from other observatories as well.

The notebooks attempt to utilize a number of software packages supported by STScI, including
`Astropy <https://www.astropy.org>`_, `glue <http://docs.glueviz.org/en/stable/index.html>`_,
`ginga <https://ginga.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `photutils <https://photutils.readthedocs.io>`_,
`specutils <https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, `astroimtools <http://astroimtools.readthedocs.io>`_,
`imexam <http://imexam.readthedocs.io>`_, `jdaviz <https://jdaviz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
`asdf <http://asdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `gwcs <https://gwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, and
`synphot <http://synphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Note jdaviz is STScI's JWST Data Analysis Visualization Tool, designed to be used with spectra, IFU cubes,
and multi-object spectroscopy (MOS).
